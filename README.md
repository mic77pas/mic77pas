## Hey!ðŸ‘‹
My name is Michael, and I'm a current student at the University of Waterloo studying Systems Design Engineering (SYDE).

I'm interested in learning all things surrounding full-stack development, UX/UI, AI, and product design!

- Iâ€™m currently working with [IpserLab](https://www.ipserlab.com/) as a SWE Intern, helping startups with front-end development and learning the ropes in Product Management.
- Iâ€™m currently learning to work with frameworks such as React, and also getting into design tools such as Figma & WebFlow
- Iâ€™m always looking for more avenues to grow and contribute so please feel free to come to me with any opportunities!
  
(I also transfered after a year of being in the Geomatics program so I know a thing or two about *GIS systems* as well!)
