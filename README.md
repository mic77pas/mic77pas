# ðŸ§— Michael Pasyechnyk
### `Systems Design Engineering @ University of Waterloo`

Interested in learning all things surrounding front-end development, UX/UI, AI, and product design!

- Iâ€™m currently working with [IpserLab](https://www.ipserlab.com/) as a SWE Intern, helping startups such as TectraLabs with front-end development and learning the ropes in Product Management.
- Iâ€™m currently learning to work with frameworks such as React, and also getting into design tools such as Figma & WebFlow
- Iâ€™m always looking for more avenues to grow and contribute so please feel free to come to me with any opportunities!
  
(I also transferred after a year of being in the Geomatics program so I know a thing or two about *GIS systems* as well! :earth_americas:)

  <summary><h3> Michael's Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>
    Hi! Iâ€™m Michael Pasyechnyk, an incoming Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a non-traditional path into tech. I originally began in Geomatics, an environmental science program at UWaterloo, where I explored data science, GIS, and digital mapping. Along the way, I found myself drawn to the creative and technical challenges of software development and product design, which led to my transition into engineering. Today, Iâ€™m focused on building my skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and AIâ€”often through hands-on projects and internships. On campus, I stay involved in a range of leadership and tech-related roles that let me contribute to student life and entrepreneurship. Outside of academics, I love travelling, climbing, drawing, and working on other side projects to further develop my skills. My journey so far has been a mix of exploration, curiosity, and continuous learningâ€”and Iâ€™m just getting started.
